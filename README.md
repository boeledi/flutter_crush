## Note about the source code

Please note that my objective was not a release the game. Therefore, there are still things which are not fully implemented or tested. Also, the structure of the code could be very much improved but this was not part of my objectives.

Also, if the source code might give you ideas to build your own game, I will be more than happy… simply let me know…
